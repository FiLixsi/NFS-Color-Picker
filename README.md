Simple tool for adjusting colors in RGBA Format.  
You can make changes to GLOBAL files using NFS-VltEd or OGVI tools (In Tool you need to Copy Decimal).  
Clicking on the Color Box will allow you to pick a color from the Windows Color Panel.  

There are two modes: RGB and XYZ. (A/W is Transparency).  
RGBA is used for particles (In Attributes: emitterdata).  
XYZW is used for car effects (In Attributes: light_flares_cg).
